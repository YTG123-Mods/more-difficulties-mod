# More Difficulties Mod
Adds new difficulties to Minecraft!

## Installing
Download and install the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use), head to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/YTG1234/more-difficulties-mod/releases/latest) and download the jar file.
<br />
Also download [Fabric API](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Fabric ASM](https://github.com/Chocohead/Fabric-ASM/releases/latest) (In the future you will not need Fabric ASM but for now you need it.)

Put all the jars in your `mods` folder inside your Minecraft instance directory:<br />
Windows: `%appdata%/.minecraft`<br />
macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`<br />
Linux: `~/.minecraft`

Or if you're using MultiMC Just open the Minecraft folder (from the button inside MultiMC).

## Building from source
As simple as:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
